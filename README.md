# Neighborhood map of Drobeta Turnu Severin, my home town

This last project was quite challenging for me. And I managed throughout the nanodegree to learn a lot of wonderful things related to CSS, HTML and Javascript.

In order to test my beautiful app, you can do it from [here] (https://rflorian2017.github.io/neighborhood-map/).

Or you can clone or download the [repository] (https://github.com/rflorian2017/neighborhood-map) and load `index.html` in your favourite browser 

## API used in the application
### [Google API] (https://developers.google.com/maps/) for loading the map and for setting markers and displaying information windows for the locations
### [Foursquare API] (https://developer.foursquare.com/) for loading the name of the Venue and the area of interest (*leisure*, *restaurant*, etc)
### [Flickr API] (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) for loading a nice picture showing you an insight of the locations

## General usage
1. The app can be run on both large displays and mobile devices.
2. On the left side of the window you have a list with the initial locations, and an input where you can fill in letters or words that return a filter.
3. Clicking on a marker or on a location item, displays an information window with the name of the location, the type of location (*leisure*, *scenery*, *etc*) and a nice picture.

`Hope you enjoy !`
